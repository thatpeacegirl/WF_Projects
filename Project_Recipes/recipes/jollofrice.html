        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>
          Jollof rice is a very popular rice dish from West Africa. There are
          many different ways to cook jollof rice and the ingredients and
          preparation methods vary across different regions. It is a dish made
          with rice, tomatoes, tomato paste, onions, red bell pepper, scotch
          bonnet peppers, salt, and spices.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is called Nigerian jollof rice because of the type of the rice that
          is used, long grain rice that has been parboiled. Other types of
          jollof rice will be made using basmati or jasmine rice. For an extra
          depth of flavor, authentic party jollof is cooked with fire wood which
          infuses a smokey flavor into the dish and it is simply magical. The
          recipe below is for 10 servings of the meal with approximately 45
          minutes prep time and 45 minutes cook time.

        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Boil the meat with onion, garlic, salt, seasoning cube, thyme,
            curry. You can use beef, chicken, turkey, goat meat etc. I use
            chicken for this recipe.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the meat is boiling, blend tomatoes, bell peppers and onion
            until smooth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer the pepper mix to a wide pot and boil until the mix reduces
            in the pot(about 15 minutes depending on how much water was used to
            blend peppers).
          </li>
          <li>
            When the meat is cooked, separate from stock then grill or air-fry
            meat until golden brown.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wash the rice multiple times until water runs clear. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large wide pot, heat up vegetable oil or the oil of choice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fry chopped onion until onion is translucent and fragrant.Add tin
            tomato/tomato paste(different from tomato sauce).
          </li>
          <li>
            Fry the tomato paste for about 15 minutes until it looks grainy.
            (Frying the tomato paste gets rid of the tangy taste).
          </li>
          <li>
            Add boiled down pepper mix,season with salt, curry, thyme and bay
            leaves. Fry for an additional 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Add meat stock or water. Stir.</li>
          <li>
            Add the washed rice, cover with foil and allow to cook for about 20
            minutes(cook time depends on the kind of rice being used).
          </li>
          <li>After 20 minutes your rice should be ready.</li>
          <li>
            Open foil, turn rice to release steam. If rice seems dry, add 3
            teaspoon of butter and allow to melt with the heat.
          </li>
          <li>Serve with chicken, fried plantain or salad.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>NOTE</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Nigerian jollof is traditionally prepared with long grain parboiled
            rice. Par excellence rice, Golden canilla and Zatarain are good
            brands.
          </li>
          <li>
            Covering with foil helps trap most of the steam in the pot. This
            helps the rice cook with less water and prevents mushy rice.
