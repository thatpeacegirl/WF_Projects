        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>
          Nigerian chin chin is a very popular snack made from a basic
          combination of flour, milk and sugar. There are other optional
          ingredients like egg, baking powder and nutmeg but these are strictly
          based on preference. Typically, it can be either hard or crunchy. This
          recipe is a fine medium between the two. If you would prefer your
          final product to be much harder, omit baking power, do not use egg and
          add 1/2 cup more flour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to adjust the recipe to meet your needs. If you need to make
          two or four times the amount, you can simply double or quadruple the
          recipe.The recipe below calls for approximately 10 minutes prep time
          and 25 minutes cook time.
